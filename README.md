# neural_networks

1. A very simple implementation of neural network 
2. Implementation of my own neural network implementation (without Pytorch or Tensorflow) - Implemented OR, AND, NOT and XOR gates 
3. Simple neural network to train 3 layered neural network on MNIST in Pytorch
4. LeNet Trained on CIFAR 100 in Pytorch 
5. AlexNet trained on TinyImage net in Pytorch
