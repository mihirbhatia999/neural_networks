### A very simple implementation of neural network 
[Reference: Siraj Raval](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3l4qz76JhQ)

### 3 layered Neural Network 
Simple NN with 3 layers implemented in Pytorch on the MNIST dataset. 

### LeNet5 Trained on CIFAR 100 in Pytorch 
Trained the LeNet5 model on CIFAR 100 dataset. 
Modified network using Batchnorm to converge faster and acheive training + validation accuracy
Also implemented a camera function that uses webcam video and classifies image that it captures.  


###  AlexNet trained on TinyImage net in Pytorch 
Used Transfer Learning with a pretrained AlexNet to train TinyImageNet by freezing all layers except the large and then training only the last layer on the TinyImageNet dataset
